# Goal: This script creates subway plots of genome synteny.
#
# First select which plotting order is desired for the chromosomes
#  chr_sort_order < custom | optimal-top | optimal-size | optimal-random >
#    custom         - use the custom sorting order for EVERY species in chromorder
#    optimal-top    - use the custom order for the topmost species, then optimizes everything else
#    optimal-size   - sort the top species' chromosomes by number of genes, optimize everything else
#    optimal-chr-or - use `chromorder` when possible, optimize everything else
#    optimal-random - randomly sort the chromosomes of the top species, optimize everything else
chr_sort_order: optimal-chr-or

# - First type in the list of species to plot
# - In this example we plot the relationships between
#   three species with the codes "EMU", "RES", and "HCA".
#   These three species must also be present in the "species"
#   entry of the config file below.
species_order:
  - EMU
  - RES
  - HCA

# - If there are any organisms for which you would like to specify the
#   chromosome order, then this is the place to do it. The species name
#   here must match the species name in the "species" part of the config
#   file.
# - Only the chromosomes here will be plotted for this species. This is an
#   easy way to just plot a subset of chromosomes that you are interested in.
chromorder:
  EMU:
    - EMU1
    - EMU6
    - EMU5
    - EMU4
    - EMU2
    - EMU3

# - This is the list of RBH files output from odp2 or another source.
# - Each RBH file contains the orthologs between species that should be
#   plotted.
# - The number of files will always be the number of species minus one.
# - Currently, only relationships that are significant with Fisher's exact
#   test will be plotted here.
rbh_files_in_order:
  - /path/to/EMU_RES_xy_reciprocal_best_hits.coloredby_BCnS_LGs.plotted.rbh
  - /path/to/HCA_RES_xy_reciprocal_best_hits.coloredby_BCnS_LGs.plotted.rbh

# - All of the species that are in "species_order" above should be here
# - This information is important for calculating some stats that are used
#   for plotting.
# - The necessary fields are:
#   - proteins
#   - chrom
#   - genome
# - If you specify "minscafsize", then only scaffolds >= this size are
#   included in the subway plot.
